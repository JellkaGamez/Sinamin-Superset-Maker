Sinamin Superset Maker is a *tool* designed to make *supersets* of various langauges such as
- Python *Most reliable*

It uses the power of AI to make you a ***cool new superset***!

## **How to use**
Type in ```batch
python sinamin_superset_maker.py
```
Follow the instructions in the program and you have your superset!

If you wish to use the compiler, use 
```batch

```
for example lets say we had a superset called *"Example"* with a compiler called *".example-compiler.py"* we would use
```batch
python .example-compiler.py script.example
```

## **Other**
Sinamin Superset Maker will always produce compilers that look like this **.file_type-compiler.py**
